We could say that Data Science is the field that tries to solve practical problems using data as primary resource, and mathematics, statistics and programming as auxiliary tools. Two of the most important problems that Data Science tries to solve are the ones of regression and classification. Next we are going to make a brief theoretical approach to these problems. "],["the-regression-problem.html", "Chapter 2 The Regression Problem", " Chapter 2 The Regression Problem A regression problem is a statistical problem that consists of predicting a quantitative response variable, using for this purpose information about predictor variables and the response itself. An example of a regression problem is the prediction of house prices based on houses features. The regression problem can be formalized as follows: We have \\(p\\) predictors \\(\\mathcal{X}_1 ,...,\\mathcal{X}_p\\) and a quantitative response \\(\\mathcal{Y}\\). We have a \\(n\\) size sample of the predictors and the response: \\(X_1,...,X_p,Y\\). Then, we have the following data matrix \\[\\mathbf{D}=[X_1,...,X_p,Y]=\\begin{pmatrix} x_{11}&amp;x_{12}&amp;...&amp;x_{1p}&amp; y_1\\\\ x_{21}&amp;x_{22}&amp;...&amp;x_{2p} &amp; y_2\\\\ ...&amp;...&amp; ...&amp; ....&amp; ...\\\\ x_{n1}&amp;x_{n2}&amp;...&amp;x_{np}&amp; y_n \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} x_{1}&amp; y_1\\\\ x_{2}&amp; y_2 \\\\ ...&amp;... \\\\ x_{n} &amp; y_n \\end{pmatrix} \\] where \\(x_i=(x_{i1},\\dots , x_{ip})^T\\in \\mathbb{R}^p\\) and \\(y_i\\in \\mathbb{R}\\). The regression problem consist on predict the quantitative response \\((\\mathcal{Y})\\) for any observation of the predictors \\((\\mathcal{X}_1,\\dots \\mathcal{X}_p)\\). The statistical solution to the regression problem is to propose a model or algorithm that uses the available data of the predictors and the response \\((\\mathbf{D})\\) to predict the response values for any observation of the predictors. "],["supervised-classification-problem.html", "Chapter 3 Supervised Classification Problem", " Chapter 3 Supervised Classification Problem A supervised classification problem is an statistical problem that consist of predicting a categorical response variable using for that purpose information about some predictor variables and the response itself. An example of supervised classification is to classify a song into one category among three music styles, taking into account some features of the song. Another example is classifying a bank customer as a potential loan defaulter based on customer and loan features. The supervised classification problem can be formalized as follows: We have \\(p\\) predictors \\(\\mathcal{X}_1 ,...,\\mathcal{X}_p\\) and a categorical response \\(\\mathcal{Y}\\). We have a \\(n\\) size sample of the predictors and the response: \\(X_1,...,X_p,Y\\). Then, we have the following data matrix \\[\\mathbf{D}=[X_1,...,X_p,Y]=\\begin{pmatrix} x_{11}&amp;x_{12}&amp;...&amp;x_{1p}&amp; y_1\\\\ x_{21}&amp;x_{22}&amp;...&amp;x_{2p} &amp; y_2\\\\ ...&amp;...&amp; ...&amp; ....&amp; ...\\\\ x_{n1}&amp;x_{n2}&amp;...&amp;x_{np}&amp; y_n \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} x_{1}&amp; y_1\\\\ x_{2}&amp; y_2 \\\\ ...&amp;... \\\\ x_{n} &amp; y_n \\end{pmatrix} \\] where \\(x_i=(x_{i1},\\dots , x_{ip})^T\\in \\mathbb{R}^p\\) and \\(y_i\\in \\lbrace 0,1,2,\\dots \\rbrace\\). The supervised classification problem consist on predict the categorical response \\((\\mathcal{Y})\\) for any observation of the predictors \\((\\mathcal{X}_1,\\dots \\mathcal{X}_p)\\). The statistical solution to the supervised classification problem is to propose a model or algorithm that uses the available data of the predictors and the response \\((\\mathbf{D})\\) to predict the response categories for any observation of the predictors. "],["unupervised-classification-problem.html", "Chapter 4 Unupervised Classification Problem", " Chapter 4 Unupervised Classification Problem The unsupervised classification problem is an statistical problem that consist of predicting a categorical response variable using for that purpose only information about predictors, because in this kind of problems we have not information about the response. The unsupervised classification problems are also known as clustering problems. An example of clustering problem is to group the customers of a company by different categories or classes depending on some features of their purchase attitudes or behaviour. The unsupervised classification problem can be formalized as follows : We have \\(p\\) predictors \\(\\mathcal{X}_1 ,...,\\mathcal{X}_p\\) and a categorical response \\(\\mathcal{Y}\\). We have a \\(n\\) size sample of the predictors, but not of the response: \\(X_1,...,X_p\\). Then, we have the following data matrix \\[\\mathbf{X}=[X_1,...,X_p]=\\begin{pmatrix} x_{11}&amp;x_{12}&amp;...&amp;x_{1p}\\\\ x_{21}&amp;x_{22}&amp;...&amp;x_{2p}\\\\ ...&amp;...&amp; ...&amp; ....\\\\ x_{n1}&amp;x_{n2}&amp;...&amp;x_{np} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} x_{1}\\\\ x_{2} \\\\ ... \\\\ x_{n} \\end{pmatrix} \\] where \\(x_i=(x_{i1},\\dots , x_{ip})^T\\in \\mathbb{R}^p\\). The unsupervised classification problem consist on predict the categorical response \\((\\mathcal{Y})\\) for any observation of the predictors \\((\\mathcal{X}_1,\\dots \\mathcal{X}_p)\\). The statistical solution to the not supervised classification problem consists on proposing a model or algorithm that uses the available sample information of the predictors \\((\\mathbf{X})\\) to predict the response categories for any observation of the predictors. "],["semi-supervised-classification.html", "Chapter 5 Semi-supervised Classification", " Chapter 5 Semi-supervised Classification A semi-supervised classification problem is an statistical problem that consist of predicting a categorical response variable using information of predictors and of the response itself. But, in this case the available sample of the response has a great percentage of missing values. The semi-supervised classification problem can be formalized as a supervised one. The statistical solution to the supervised classification problem is to propose a model or algorithm that uses the available data of the predictors and the response \\((\\mathbf{D})\\) to predict the response categories for any observation of the predictors. "],["unsupervised-regression.html", "Chapter 6 Unsupervised Regression", " Chapter 6 Unsupervised Regression To extrapolate the unsupervised classification problem to the regression one is easy, switching the response condition from categorical to quantitative is the only requirement. Unfortunately this problem hasn’t standard solutions due to its complexity. "],["bibliography.html", "Chapter 7 Bibliography", " Chapter 7 Bibliography Galeano San Miguel, Pedro. (2022).
